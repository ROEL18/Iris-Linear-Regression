# Iris Linear Regression

This repository contains a linear regression model built using the Iris dataset. The goal is to predict the petal width of Iris flowers based on their sepal length, sepal width, and petal length.

## Introduction
Linear regression is a basic and commonly used type of predictive analysis. The overall idea of regression is to examine two things:
1. Does a set of predictor variables do a good job in predicting an outcome (dependent) variable?
2. Which variables in particular are significant predictors of the outcome variable, and in what way do they impact the outcome variable?

In this project, we use linear regression to predict the petal width of Iris flowers based on their sepal length, sepal width, and petal length.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics. It contains 150 observations of iris flowers with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset is available in the `sklearn.datasets` module.

## Dependencies
To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-linear-regression.git
cd iris-linear-regression
```

2. Run the script:
```bash
python iris_linear_regression.py
```

### Script Details
- `iris_linear_regression.py`: This script loads the Iris dataset, preprocesses the data, trains a linear regression model, and visualizes the results.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Load the dataset
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
iris = load_iris()
data = pd.DataFrame(data= np.c_[iris['data'], iris['target']],
                    columns= iris['feature_names'] + ['target'])

# Use sepal length, sepal width, and petal length to predict petal width
X = data[['sepal length (cm)', 'sepal width (cm)', 'petal length (cm)']]
y = data['petal width (cm)']

# Split the data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')

# Plot the results
plt.scatter(y_test, y_pred)
plt.xlabel('True Values')
plt.ylabel('Predictions')
plt.title('True Values vs Predictions')
plt.show()
```

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE). A scatter plot of the true values versus the predicted values is also generated to visualize the model's accuracy.
